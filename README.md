# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A content-based movie recommender system built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Machine Learning**. Select any movie, and it will suggest 5 similar movies along with their posters using the TMDb API.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Content-based filtering using genres, keywords, cast & crew
- ✅ Cosine similarity for recommendation
- ✅ Fetches posters from TMDb API
- ✅ Lightweight and easy-to-use Streamlit interface
- ✅ Clean, fast, and responsive results

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Combines movie and credit data, extracts key features (genres, keywords, top 3 cast members, director).
2. **Tag Creation**: Creates a textual representation (`tags`) for each movie.
3. **Vectorization**: Converts tags into vectors using `CountVectorizer`.
4. **Similarity Calculation**: Computes pairwise cosine similarity between movies.
5. **Recommendation**: Returns top 5 similar movies based on selected title.
6. **Poster Display**: Uses TMDb API to fetch and show movie posters.

🔑 TMDb API Key
---
To fetch movie posters, you need a TMDb API key.

1. Sign up at TMDb

2. Navigate to Settings > API > Create API Key

3. Replace the placeholder in app.py
```bash
  API_KEY = "your_tmdb_api_key"
```
